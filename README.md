If you want to become a Certified Kubernetes Administrator or you just want to learn Kubernetes from scratch and
understand everything this repo is a good choice for you.

In this repo, you'll be prepared to pass the exam, and you'll also learn more about Kubernetes concepts that
that are not relevant to the exam such as `Kubernetes on AWS (EKS)`,`Operators`, `Helm charts`, `Microservices`, `Prometheus`, and most importantly,
install and set up a K8s cluster (In the exam, you won't have to install a cluster from scratch, but knowing how to do
it gives you a **huge advantage!**)

With this repo and other sources that I mentioned below, you'll prepare to pass the exam and be confident about your
Kubernetes knowledge!

Have Fun!
